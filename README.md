# OpenVAS-LAB
The aim of the OpenVAS vulnerability lab project is to provide a comprehensive OpenVAS vunnerability Scan. These are two  main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. We will be using OpenVAS(greenhouse) to scan Cloud VMs hosted on MS AZURE in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation. 

1. Create our Free Azure Account
  a) create an openVAS machine and ssh -username for the machine @ipaddress. 
2. Prepare Vulnerability Management Scanner
3. Create Client Virtual Machine and Make it vulnerable
4. Perform Unauthenticated scan
5. Make Configurations for Authenticated Scans (Within VM)
6. Make Configurations for Authenticated Scans (OpenVAS)
7. Perform Authenticated Scan against our Vulnerable Windows
8. Remediate Vulnerabilies.
9. Verify Remediation.
